# gRPC

This directory contains the Makefile and the template manifest for the most
recent version of gRPC (as of this writing, version 3.18.0). This was tested
on a machine with SGX v1 and Ubuntu 18.04.

The Makefile and the template manifest contain extensive comments and are made
self-explanatory. Please review them to gain understanding of Graphene-SGX
and requirements for applications running under Graphene-SGX.

# Quick Start

Build graphene-sgx first and replacing ./grpc/examples/cpp/helloworld/ratls and ./grpc/examples/cpp/helloworld/mbedtls with the corresponding items which graphene builds if following make gives link-time error.

```sh
# build gRPC and the final manifest
make SGX=1

# run gRPC server in Graphene-SGX against a benchmark
make run

# clean gRPC server and rebuild gRPC server
make clean
make SGX=1
make run

# clean gRPC source and installed packages
make distclean 
```
