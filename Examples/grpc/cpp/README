# gRPC

This directory contains the Makefile and the template manifest for the most
recent version of gRPC (as of this writing, version 3.18.0). This was tested
on a machine with SGX v1 and Ubuntu 18.04.

The Makefile and the template manifest contain extensive comments and are made
self-explanatory. Please review them to gain understanding of Graphene-SGX
and requirements for applications running under Graphene-SGX.

# Quick Start

```sh
# build gRPC and the final manifest
make SGX=1

# run original Redis against a benchmark (redis-benchmark supplied with Redis)
./redis-server --save '' --protected-mode no &
src/src/redis-benchmark
kill %%

# run Redis in non-SGX Graphene against a benchmark
graphene-direct redis-server --save '' --protected-mode no &
src/src/redis-benchmark
kill %%

# run Redis in Graphene-SGX against a benchmark
graphene-sgx redis-server --save '' --protected-mode no &
src/src/redis-benchmark
kill %%
```
